 <p class="design-paragraph">
Our Brand focuses on self expression and embracing values like Authenticity, Uniqueness and Determination.
We want to sell individual pieces of clothing to people to help them express oneself more, regardless of their gender. 
Therefore we created a unisex fashion clothing store. The style of our brand is urban street style and we focus on selling unique jackets as statement pieces. We stuck mainly to the brand colors which are Red, Yellow and Grey and implemented those on our website. 
We choose for mainly red because it is our main brand color that transports warmth and is standing for passion, determination and power, which fits our brand perfectly. The grey resembles urban concrete and we worked with a bit of texture in the background of the pages to give a better feeling. The exact Hex color code can be found down below. 
The clothing is mainly about street style hence we focused with our visuals to transport the graffiti urban vibe, that is fitting with our brand.
<br>
The Fonts that we choose to use are “Allan” for headlines and “Josefin Sans” for paragraphs from Google Fonts. Examples can be found down below. Both fonts can be described as a bit more gritty and wild, which is fitting to our brand. We want to go against the norm and sleek designs.
<br>
<br>
Task Flow:<br>
We want to give our user an easy shopping experience, that starts with our home page. Here will the customer experience the feeling of the brand and will find an easy indication towards the shop, in form of a button. In the shop, The user has an overview over the products, our unique Jackets. 
After deciding on a product that seems interesting, we get to the product page where more information awaits. Here, the customer gets information about size choices, the stock and the option to fill in the quantity that the customer wants from the product.
If the user decides to put the product into the shopping card, we get to the shopping card section. Here the user sees all the information about his soon to be purchase, and the quantity as well as the size they decided on. At the bottom, the prize will be indicated again as well as a check out button, that directs the customer to the checkout form and payment information. After the payment has been done the customer gets a confirmation.
<br>
Other than the Shop, we provide information about us, in the “About Us” section. On this page, the customer learns about our story and vision, in order for us to be more transparent to our clients. It gives better inside into who we are and builds a closer bond with our users. Further down we also have information about ourselves with pictures to give our company a face, aiming to be less anonymous. 
We also talk about our values and what is important to us with our brand. This gives more indication about what the brand is about to help customers understand us better.
<br>
If there are still questions left or possible feedback wants to be given, we have a Contact page. On this page the user can write us per email which is in form of a contact page to make the process easier. There is also a possibility to call for urgent matters or to follow us on our social media platforms to stay connected. We hope to be as reachable as possible for our clients with the intention of building a good trust foundation.<br>
We want to be there for our clients and want them to enjoy our brand, therefore we want to be easy approachable and transparent to form connections and long lasting customers.
<br>
<br>
Each page is highlighted in the navigation bar, so the customer knows exactly where they are at the moment.
We also provide a footer at the bottom of each page, which is also an easy excess to our social media platforms and indicates our copyrights. We also provide information about is in a quick overview and a quick menu, so that the unser doesn't need to scroll all the way back up to the navigation bar to change the page.
<br>
<br>


Down below the Wireframe of the Home page as well as the one of the About us page can be found.
<br>
We prototyped our website first on paper before turning them into code. We changed some minor things with the about page in the form of constellation, but the content is the same.
<br>
<br>
Testing:<br>
We tested our paper prototype with 5 people in the age from 20 to 26 via Skype interviews. 
Our testers were given the home landing page and were supposed to order a jacket from the store. 
They all managed to order the jacket and a few went to the about page first to find out more about the brand, before purchasing something from us. They also visited the contact page to see if we have any social media channels that they could visit for more content. 
Overall they liked the style of the Website and the simplistic design, that helped them to navigate better. They also like the idea of a size calculator to help them picking the correct size they need. The overall design refleckted our brand and message well and transported the desired urban feeling, in our testers eyes.
All the testers liked the easy navigation and usability of the website. A few would have liked a bit more filters and a Q and A of questions. When we tested with the paper prototype we put the check-out basket next to the page the user was on, but we realised it would be better to give it a spot in the navigation bar for an easy access. Further Improvement that could be made would be to add shipping information to the check out form. We also would add a menu to the side of the shop for better search options but we weren't able to code a working menu, despite our efforts.
